# Authentication System Testing Guide

This guide outlines the testing process for the overhauled authentication system in the CareSyncRx application.

## Overview

The authentication system has been completely rebuilt to address persistent issues with unexpected redirects to the login page. This document provides guidance on how to test the new system to ensure it works correctly.

## Testing Approach

We've implemented a three-tiered testing approach:

1. **Component-level testing**: Verify individual authentication components with the auth integration test page
2. **System integration testing**: Test the interaction between authentication components using the automated test script
3. **Real-world flow testing**: Verify the authentication system works correctly in real user scenarios

## Testing Tools

We've created several tools to facilitate testing:

### 1. Auth Integration Test Page

Location: `http://localhost:3000/auth-integration-test.html`

This page provides component-level tests for:
- Token Management System
- Auth Navigation Integration
- Device Identity Integration
- Simulated Token Refresh

Each test can be run independently to verify that individual components are working correctly.

### 2. Automated Test Script

Location: `Test-AuthIntegration.ps1`

This PowerShell script automates the testing process by:
- Starting the development server if it's not already running
- Opening the auth integration test page in your browser
- Guiding you through the testing process

Run it with:
```powershell
.\Test-AuthIntegration.ps1
```

### 3. Real-World Flow Test Script

Location: `Test-AuthRealWorldFlow.ps1`

This script guides you through testing the actual authentication flow in the application, including:
- Login process
- Protected pages access
- Browser navigation
- Session persistence
- Logout process

Run it with:
```powershell
.\Test-AuthRealWorldFlow.ps1
```

## Expected Behavior

After the authentication system overhaul, the application should:

1. **Login correctly**: Users should be able to log in and access protected pages
2. **Navigate seamlessly**: Users should be able to navigate between pages without unexpected redirects
3. **Handle browser actions**: Back/forward navigation, page refresh, and opening new tabs should work correctly
4. **Maintain session**: Session should persist appropriately and token refresh should happen automatically
5. **Logout properly**: Users should be able to log out and be prevented from accessing protected pages

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during testing:

1. **Check the browser console** for any error messages
2. **Review the documentation** in the `docs` folder:
   - `auth-system-overhaul.md`: Comprehensive overview of the changes made
   - `auth-fix-verification-guide.md`: Detailed guide for verifying the fixes
3. **Examine the token state** using the browser developer tools:
   - Open the Application tab
   - Check Local Storage for token values
   - Verify that tokens are being refreshed correctly

## Reporting Issues

If you find issues that weren't addressed by the authentication system overhaul, please report them with:

1. A detailed description of the issue
2. Steps to reproduce the problem
3. Browser console logs showing any errors
4. Network request logs for any failed API calls
5. The version of the application being tested

## Conclusion

This testing guide provides a comprehensive approach to verifying that the authentication system overhaul has successfully addressed the persistent issues with unexpected redirects and login loops. By following the outlined testing process, you can ensure that the authentication system is working correctly in all scenarios.
