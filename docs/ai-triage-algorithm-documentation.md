## Provider Scoring System

### Base Confidence Score
Every provider evaluation starts with a **50% base confidence** score, which is then adjusted by multiple factors:

### Scoring Factors

| Factor | Weight Range | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Workload Penalty** | -20% to +10% | Based on current case assignments |
| **Availability Bonus** | -15% to +15% | Available appointment slots |
| **Specialty Match** | +15% to +40% | Clinical expertise alignment |
| **Role Suitability** | +5% to +25% | Provider type for case urgency |
| **AI Provider Match** | +20% | AI-recommended provider type match ⭐ NEW |
| **Utilization Rate** | -15% to +15% | Provider capacity management |
| **Time Availability** | +5% to +10% | Next available appointment timing |

### Confidence Score Calculation

```typescript
let confidence = 50; // Base score

// Workload Analysis
const workloadRatio = currentWorkload / maxWorkload;
if (workloadRatio > 0.8) confidence -= 20;      // High workload
else if (workloadRatio > 0.5) confidence -= 10; // Medium workload  
else confidence += 10;                           // Good availability

// Availability Scoring
if (hasAvailableSlots) confidence += 15;
else confidence -= 15;

// Specialty Matching (detailed below)
confidence += specialtyMatchScore; // 15-40 points

// Role-Based Adjustments (detailed below)
confidence += roleBasedScore; // 5-25 points

// AI Provider Type Matching ⭐ NEW
if (aiSuggestion?.recommendedProvider) {
  const aiRecommendedType = aiSuggestion.recommendedProvider.toLowerCase();
  const providerRole = provider.role.toLowerCase();
  
  if (
    (aiRecommendedType.includes('nurse') && providerRole === 'nurse') ||
    (aiRecommendedType.includes('doctor') && providerRole === 'doctor') ||
    (aiRecommendedType.includes('pharmacist') && providerRole === 'pharmacist')
  ) {
    confidence += 20; // Strong AI recommendation bonus
  }
}

// Utilization Rate Balancing
if (utilizationRate < 30) confidence += 15;      // Excellent availability
else if (utilizationRate < 60) confidence += 8;  // Good availability
else if (utilizationRate < 80) confidence -= 5;  // Moderate availability
else confidence -= 15;                           // Limited availability

// Time-Sensitive Bonus
if (availableWithin2Hours) confidence += 10;
else if (availableWithin24Hours) confidence += 5;

// Normalize to 20-95% range
confidence = Math.min(95, Math.max(20, confidence));
```

## Urgency Classification

The algorithm automatically classifies case urgency using keyword analysis:

### Urgency Levels

#### HIGH Urgency (Immediate Attention Required)
**Keywords**: chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, severe, extreme, intense, dizzy, cannot breathe, breathing problems

**Provider Preference**: Doctors receive +10% bonus for high-urgency cases

#### MEDIUM Urgency (Medical Evaluation Needed)
**Keywords**: fever, cough, persistent, headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing issues, mild shortness

**Provider Preference**: Nurses receive +10% bonus for medium urgency cases

#### LOW Urgency (Routine Care)
**Keywords**: mild, slight, occasional, minor

**Provider Preference**: Nurses receive additional consideration for routine care

### Urgency Detection Logic
```typescript
const hasHighUrgencyKeywords = urgencies.high.some(keyword => 
  symptomLowerCase.includes(keyword));

if (hasHighUrgencyKeywords) {
  suggestedUrgency = 'HIGH';
} else if (hasLowUrgencyKeywords && !hasMediumUrgencyKeywords) {
  suggestedUrgency = 'LOW';  
} else {
  suggestedUrgency = 'MEDIUM';
}
```

## Specialty Matching

### Clinical Domain Mapping

| Specialty | Keywords | Confidence Bonus |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Cardiology** | chest pain, heart, palpitation, blood pressure, cardiac | +40% |
| **Pulmonary** | cough, breathing, lung, respiratory, shortness of breath | +35% |
| **Emergency Medicine** | severe, extreme, emergency, urgent, critical, acute | +35% |
| **Neurology** | headache, migraine, dizziness, numbness | +30% |
| **General Medicine** | fever, cold, flu + respiratory symptoms | +25% |
| **Family Practice** | General symptoms | +15% |

### Advanced Specialty Logic

```typescript
// Strong Specialty Matches
if (specialtyLower.includes('cardiology') && 
    symptomLowerCase.includes('chest pain')) {
  confidence += 40;
  matchReason += 'Strong match: Cardiology specialty for cardiac symptoms.';
}

// Cross-Specialty Competency  
if (specialtyLower.includes('general medicine') && 
    symptomLowerCase.includes('shortness of breath')) {
  confidence += 25; // General medicine can handle respiratory issues
}

// Expertise-Level Matching
if (expertise.includes('respiratory') && 
    symptomLowerCase.includes('breathing')) {
  confidence += 30; // Specific expertise bonus
}
```

## Workload Balancing

The algorithm implements intelligent workload distribution to prevent provider burnout and optimize resource utilization:

### Workload Metrics
- **Current Assigned Triages**: Active cases per provider
- **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of capacity being used
- **Available Slots**: Open appointment slots
- **Maximum Workload**: Configurable per provider (default: 10)

### Balancing Logic
```typescript
// Prevent Overload
if (workloadRatio > 80%) confidence -= 20; // Heavy penalty for overloaded providers

// Encourage Underutilized Providers  
if (utilizationRate < 30%) confidence += 15; // Boost underutilized providers

// Gradual Load Distribution
const idealUtilization = 60%;
const deviationPenalty = Math.abs(utilizationRate - idealUtilization) / 10;
confidence -= deviationPenalty;
```

## Role-Based Adjustments

Each healthcare provider role has specific strengths and appropriate use cases:

### DOCTOR (Physician)
- **Base Bonus**: +15%
- **High Urgency Bonus**: +10% (total +25%)
- **Best For**: Complex diagnoses, high-urgency cases, comprehensive care

### NURSE (Nurse Practitioner)  
- **Base Bonus**: +5%
- **Medium/Low Urgency Bonus**: +10% (total +15%)
- **Best For**: Routine care, follow-ups, patient education

### PHARMACIST
- **Medication-Related Bonus**: +25%
- **Non-Medication Penalty**: -10%
- **Keywords**: medication, drug, prescription, side effect
- **Best For**: Drug interactions, dosage questions, pharmaceutical care

### Role Assignment Logic
```typescript
switch (provider.role) {
  case UserRole.DOCTOR:
    confidence += 15;
    if (suggestedUrgency === 'HIGH') confidence += 10;
    break;
    
  case UserRole.NURSE:
    confidence += 5;
    if (suggestedUrgency === 'MEDIUM' || suggestedUrgency === 'LOW') confidence += 10;
    break;
    
  case UserRole.PHARMACIST:
    if (symptomLowerCase.includes('medication')) confidence += 25;
    else confidence -= 10;
    break;
}
```

## Time-Sensitive Scheduling

The algorithm considers appointment availability timing to optimize patient access:

### Availability Scoring
- **Within 2 Hours**: +10% confidence bonus
- **Within 24 Hours**: +5% confidence bonus  
- **Beyond 24 Hours**: No bonus

### Next Available Calculation
```typescript
// Calculate next available appointment
if (hasAvailableSlots) {
  nextAvailable = new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Tomorrow
} else {
  // Find next available day based on provider schedule
  const nextAvailableDay = findNextAvailableDay(provider.availability);
  nextAvailable = calculateNextAvailableDate(nextAvailableDay);
}

// Time-based confidence adjustment
const hoursUntilAvailable = (nextAvailable - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
if (hoursUntilAvailable < 2) confidence += 10;
else if (hoursUntilAvailable < 24) confidence += 5;
```

## External AI/ML Integration

### Primary AI/ML Service
The algorithm integrates with a dedicated AI/ML service (caresyncrxAIMLapi) for advanced medical analysis:

#### Service Features
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/healthcare/triage`
- **Advanced NLP**: Symptom extraction and categorization
- **Medical Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive medical reasoning
- **Provider Type Recommendations**: AI-driven provider matching
- **Urgency Assessment**: Multi-factor urgency classification

#### API Integration
```typescript
async function callExternalAIService(symptoms, patientAge, urgency, medicalHistory, patientGender) {
  const payload = {
    symptoms,
    medicalHistory: medicalHistory || []
  };
  
  // Include optional fields only if valid
  if (patientAge && patientAge > 0 && patientAge <= 150) {
    payload.patientAge = patientAge;
  }
  
  if (urgency && ['low', 'moderate', 'high', 'critical'].includes(urgency.toLowerCase())) {
    payload.urgency = urgency.toLowerCase();
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(`${AI_API_URL}/api/v1/healthcare/triage`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': AI_API_KEY,
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${AI_SERVICE_JWT_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  return {
    severity: result.data?.urgency?.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + result.data?.urgency?.slice(1),
    recommendedProvider: result.data?.recommended_provider,
    reasoning: result.data?.reasoning
  };
}
```

#### AI Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "triage_level": "moderate",
    "recommended_provider": "nurse practitioner", 
    "reasoning": "Based on symptoms analysis, medical AI assessment recommends nurse practitioner evaluation.",
    "urgency": "moderate",
    "analysis": {
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "urgencyScore": 3,
      "model": "local-model"
    }
  }
}
```

### AI Provider Type Matching ⭐ NEW FEATURE

```typescript
// AI Provider Type Matching
if (aiSuggestion?.recommendedProvider) {
  const aiRecommendedType = aiSuggestion.recommendedProvider.toLowerCase();
  const providerRole = provider.role.toLowerCase();
  
  // Direct role matches get +20 confidence boost
  if (
    (aiRecommendedType.includes('nurse') && providerRole === 'nurse') ||
    (aiRecommendedType.includes('doctor') && providerRole === 'doctor') ||
    (aiRecommendedType.includes('pharmacist') && providerRole === 'pharmacist')
  ) {
    confidence += 20; // Strong AI recommendation bonus
  }
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Medical Expertise**: AI provides clinical reasoning for provider selection
- **Consistency**: Standardized provider type recommendations

```typescript
function localSymptomAnalysis(symptoms: string) {
  const symptomsLower = symptoms.toLowerCase();
  
  // Use determineUrgencyLevel() for urgency assessment
  const urgency = determineUrgencyLevel(symptoms);
  
  // Provider type determination
  if (symptomsLower.includes('chest pain') || symptomsLower.includes('cardiac')) {
    return { severity: urgency, recommendedProvider: 'Physician' };
  } else if (symptomsLower.includes('medication') || symptomsLower.includes('drug')) {
    return { severity: urgency, recommendedProvider: 'Pharmacist' };
  } else {
    return { severity: urgency, recommendedProvider: 'Nurse Practitioner' };
  }
}
```

```typescript
const urgencies = {
  high: ['chest pain', 'shortness of breath', 'difficulty breathing', 'severe', 
         'extreme', 'intense', 'dizzy', 'cannot breathe', 'breathing problems'],
  medium: ['fever', 'cough', 'persistent', 'headache', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 
           'breathing issues', 'mild shortness'],
  low: ['mild', 'slight', 'occasional', 'minor']
};
```

#### Urgency Decision Logic
1. **HIGH Priority**: Contains any high-urgency keywords
2. **LOW Priority**: Contains low-urgency keywords AND no medium-urgency keywords
3. **MEDIUM Priority**: Default case for all other scenarios

#### Specialty Keywords Mapping
```typescript
const specialties = {
  cardiology: ['chest pain', 'heart', 'palpitation', 'blood pressure', 'cardiac'],
  pulmonary: ['cough', 'breathing', 'lung', 'respiratory', 'shortness of breath'],
  emergency: ['severe', 'extreme', 'emergency', 'urgent', 'critical', 'acute'],
  neurology: ['headache', 'migraine', 'dizziness', 'numbness'],
  general: ['fever', 'cold', 'flu']
};
```

### 2. Provider Scoring Algorithm

Each provider receives a confidence score starting at **50%** base confidence, with adjustments based on multiple factors:

#### A. Workload Assessment

| Workload Ratio | Confidence Adjustment | Reasoning |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| > 80% | -20 points | High workload penalty |
| 50-80% | -10 points | Medium workload penalty |
| < 50% | +10 points | Good availability bonus |

#### B. Schedule Availability

| Condition | Confidence Adjustment | Details |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Has available slots | +15 points | Immediate availability |
| No available slots | -15 points | Must calculate next available |

**Next Available Calculation:**
1. Check today's availability
2. If unavailable today, find next available day (up to 7 days)
3. Calculate appointment scheduling priority

#### C. Specialty Matching

| Specialty Match Type | Confidence Bonus | Examples |
|---------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Perfect Match** | +40 points | Cardiology for chest pain |
| **Strong Match** | +35 points | Pulmonary for breathing issues |
| **Good Match** | +25-30 points | General medicine for respiratory |
| **Basic Match** | +15-20 points | General expertise |

**Enhanced Specialty Matching:**
- **Cardiology/Cardiac**: +40 for chest pain, heart issues, palpitations
- **Pulmonary/Respiratory**: +35 for breathing difficulties, cough, lung issues
- **General Medicine/Family Practice**: +25 for respiratory, +15 for general
- **Neurology**: +30 for headaches, dizziness, numbness
- **Emergency/Urgent Care**: +35 for high urgency, +20 for general emergency expertise

#### D. Expertise Sub-Matching

Within each specialty, specific expertise areas receive additional scoring:

| Expertise Type | Bonus | Trigger Conditions |
|----------------|-------|-------------------|
| Respiratory/Breathing expertise | +30 | Breathing-related symptoms |
| Specific symptom expertise | +20 | Direct keyword match |

#### E. Role-Based Adjustments

| Provider Role | Base Bonus | Additional Conditions |
|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| **DOCTOR** | +15 | +10 for HIGH urgency cases |
| **NURSE** | +5 | +10 for MEDIUM/LOW urgency |
| **PHARMACIST** | Base | +25 for medication-related, -10 for others |

#### F. Utilization Rate Balancing

| Utilization Rate | Confidence Adjustment | Provider Status |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| < 30% | +15 points | Excellent availability |
| 30-60% | +8 points | Good availability |
| 60-80% | -5 points | Moderate availability |
| > 80% | -15 points | Limited availability |

#### G. Time-Sensitive Scheduling

| Next Available Time | Bonus | Reasoning |
|--------------------|-------|-----------|
| < 2 hours | +10 points | Immediate availability |
| < 24 hours | +5 points | Same-day availability |
| > 24 hours | No bonus | Scheduled availability |

### 3. Final Score Calculation

```typescript
// Confidence bounds
confidence = Math.min(95, Math.max(20, confidence));
```

- **Minimum Confidence**: 20%
- **Maximum Confidence**: 95%
- **Sorting**: Descending by confidence score
- **Selection**: Top 3 providers returned

### 4. Recommendation Output

#### Provider Recommendation Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  role: UserRole,
  specialty: string,
  confidence: number,        // 20-95%
  reason: string,           // Detailed explanation
  nextAvailable: string,    // ISO datetime
  currentWorkload: number,  // Current active cases
  availableSlots: number    // Available appointment slots
}
```

#### Analysis Generation

The algorithm generates human-readable analysis including:

1. **Urgency Assessment**: Based on calculated priority level
2. **Symptom Analysis**: Specific medical insights based on keywords
3. **Provider Recommendation**: Summary of why the top provider was selected

**Analysis Examples:**
- HIGH: "This appears to be a situation requiring prompt medical attention."
- MEDIUM: "This requires medical evaluation but is not immediately urgent."
- LOW: "This appears to be a minor concern that should be addressed at your convenience."

### 5. External AI Integration

The CareSyncRx triage system now integrates with **OpenAI GPT-4** to provide sophisticated medical analysis and provider recommendations. This integration significantly enhances the accuracy and clinical reasoning of the triage process.
