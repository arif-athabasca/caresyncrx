  - [ ] Set up issue templates
  - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions

### Initial Commit
- [ ] Run final-github-prep.ps1 script
- [ ] Initialize Git repository locally
- [ ] Add all files to Git
- [ ] Create initial commit
- [ ] Push to GitHub

### Post-Push Tasks
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions are running correctly
- [ ] Check repository documentation rendering
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Create development branch
- [ ] Add collaborators
- [ ] Configure webhook integrations if needed

## Execution Steps

1. Run validation and cleanup:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:all
   node scripts/cleanup-empty-files.cjs
   ```

2. Test application functionality:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-app-functionality.cjs
   ```

3. Prepare for GitHub:
   ```bash
   npm run prepare:github:enhanced
   ```

4. Initialize Git and push:
