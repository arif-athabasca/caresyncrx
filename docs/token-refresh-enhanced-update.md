# Enhanced Token Refresh Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced token refresh mechanism implemented in CareSyncRx.

## Implementation Details

### TokenUtil Class Enhancements
The TokenUtil class has been enhanced to support a more robust token refresh mechanism:
- Proactive token refresh before expiration
- Better handling of refresh failures
- Improved error reporting

### Flow Diagram
1. User performs authenticated action
2. Application checks token validity
3. If token is near expiration, refresh occurs automatically
4. New token is stored using TokenStorage
5. Original request continues with new token

### Error Handling
The enhanced implementation includes better error handling:
- Network error recovery
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Clear user messaging for authentication issues

## Testing
The enhanced token refresh has been tested for:
- Different network conditions
- Various expiration scenarios
- Edge cases around concurrent refreshes
- Browser and device compatibility

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for refresh token rotation
- Implement token revocation capabilities
- Add detailed refresh metrics and logging
