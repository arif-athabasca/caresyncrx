  - Schedule slot availability
  - Provider role and expertise
  - Confidence scoring (20-95% range)
- **Real-time Availability**: Integration with actual provider schedules

### 3. **Provider Assignment System** (`/api/admin/triage/[id]/assign`)
- **Smart Assignment Logic**: Validates provider credentials and clinic restrictions
- **Care Action Creation**: Automatic scheduling for assigned appointments
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Full HIPAA-compliant activity tracking
- **Status Management**: Automated triage status updates and workflow

### 4. **Professional Scheduler Dashboard** (`/admin/schedule`)
- **Multi-View Interface**: Calendar, Workload, and Assignment views
- **Real-time Data**: Live provider availability and utilization metrics
- **Interactive Calendar**: Visual time slot management with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Workload Analytics**: Utilization percentages, slot statistics, and performance metrics
- **Assignment Tracking**: Complete triage assignment history with status indicators

### 5. **Enhanced Triage Management**
- **Dynamic Triage List**: Real-time filtering by status, urgency, and search terms
- **AI Recommendation Display**: Visual confidence scores and provider suggestions
- **Status Tracking**: Complete workflow from PENDING → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- **Provider Integration**: Direct links to scheduling and assignment interfaces

### 6. **Schedule Management APIs**
- **`/api/admin/schedule`**: Comprehensive schedule data retrieval and slot creation
- **`/api/admin/schedule/[id]`**: Individual slot management (GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Provider Availability**: Real-time slot availability and conflict detection
- **Workload Calculation**: Automatic utilization rate updates

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin-only access to triage and scheduling features
- **Audit Logging**: Every action logged with user, timestamp, and metadata
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **PIPEDA/HIPAA Compliance**: PHI data handling with proper encryption and access controls

### **AI Integration Architecture**
```typescript
// External AI Service → Local Fallback → Provider Matching → Confidence Scoring
const aiSuggestion = await callExternalAIService(symptoms) || localSymptomAnalysis(symptoms);
const providerRecommendations = matchProvidersWithAI(providers, aiSuggestion, symptoms);
```

### **Database Optimizations**
- **Indexed Queries**: Optimized lookups on provider availability, specialty, and schedule
- **Efficient Joins**: Minimized N+1 queries with strategic includes
- **Real-time Updates**: Workload calculations cached with 30-minute refresh cycles

```
1. Review Triage Details → 2. View AI Recommendations → 3. Select Provider → 4. Schedule Appointment → 5. Confirm Assignment
```

### **3. Manage Schedule** (`/admin/schedule`)
```
1. View Calendar/Workload → 2. Monitor Utilization → 3. Adjust Assignments → 4. Track Performance
```
