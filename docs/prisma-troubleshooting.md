# Prisma Client Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet

**Error Message**:
```
Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet. Please run "prisma generate" and try to import it again.
```

**Cause**:
This error occurs when your application tries to use the Prisma Client before it has been properly generated. This can happen in a few scenarios:

1. You haven't run `prisma generate` after installing or updating Prisma
2. You're using a new environment (like a fresh clone of the repository)
3. The Prisma schema has been modified but the client hasn't been regenerated
4. There's an issue with how the Prisma client is being initialized in your application

**Solutions**:

1. **Run Prisma Generate**:
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Check the Project Structure**:
   Make sure the Prisma client is correctly initialized in your application. In Next.js, it's common to use a singleton pattern to avoid multiple instances.

3. **Use the Auto-Regeneration Script**:
   CareSyncRx includes an auto-regeneration script that runs before starting the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm run dev:clean
   ```

4. **Clear Cached Build Files**:
   ```
   rm -rf .next
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```
   rmdir /s /q .next
   ```

5. **Verify Imports**:
   Make sure you're importing Prisma correctly in your components. In server components and API routes, import it like this:
   ```typescript
   import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';
   ```
   or
   ```typescript
   import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
   ```

### Prisma Client Generation Issues

If you're having issues with Prisma client generation, try these steps:

1. **Clean Prisma Cache**:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev --name reset --skip-generate
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Verify Schema Syntax**:
   ```
   npx prisma validate
   ```

3. **Check for Environmental Issues**:
   - Node.js version compatibility
   - Permissions issues
   - Network access (if using Prisma Data Platform)

### Database Connection Issues

If Prisma can't connect to your database:

1. **Check Connection String**:
   Verify that your `.env` file contains the correct database connection string.

2. **Verify Database Availability**:
   Make sure your database server is running and accessible.

3. **Check Network Settings**:
   Ensure firewalls or network policies aren't blocking the connection.

## Automated Fixes

CareSyncRx includes scripts to automate common fixes:

- **Regenerate Prisma Client**:
  ```
  npm run prisma:generate
  ```

- **Validate Prisma Schema**:
  ```
  npm run prisma:validate
  ```
