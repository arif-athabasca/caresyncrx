# Enum Standardization and Type Definition Fixes

## Changes Made

1. **Updated auth-models.ts**
   - Consolidated all interfaces and types related to authentication
   - Added missing fields to existing interfaces
   - Added proper type definitions for UserRole, TokenType, etc.
   - Ensured consistency with interfaces used in AuthService

2. **Created TypeScript definition file for token-util.js**
   - Added proper TypeScript definitions for TokenUtil methods
   - Fixed issues with missing type declarations

3. **Created type fix helper file**
   - Added `token-util-fix.ts` with module augmentation to fix missing types

4. **Fixed AuthService.ts type errors**
   - Updated TokenUtil method calls with proper type assertions
   - Fixed issues with TokenPair interface compliance
   - Fixed user creation with conditional clinic assignment
   - Improved handling of temp token generation
   - Fixed device mapping with proper type assertions

5. **Enhanced error handling**
   - Added more robust error handling for TokenUtil methods
   - Added fallbacks for methods that might not be available

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the authentication flow with the new type definitions
   - Verify that all role-based components work correctly
   - Ensure the UI correctly displays all 9 roles

2. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new enum standardization
   - Document the auth-related interfaces and types

3. **Code Quality**
   - Consider adding more comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Add explicit return types to all methods

These changes complete the standardization of enums throughout the CareSyncRx application and fix the TypeScript errors that were occurring due to inconsistent type definitions.
