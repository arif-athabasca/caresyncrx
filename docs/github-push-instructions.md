# Creating a GitHub Repository and Pushing the Code

To create a GitHub repository and push the CareSyncRx code, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using the provided script

1. Run the PowerShell script:
   ```powershell
   .\push-to-github.ps1
   ```

   This script will:
   - Validate the code
   - Initialize a git repository
   - Set up the remote
   - Commit the code
   - Push to GitHub

## Option 2: Manual steps

If you prefer to do this manually, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/arif-athabasca/
   - Click "New" to create a new repository
   - Name it "caresyncrx"
   - Add a description: "CareSyncRx application with resolved circular dependencies"
   - Choose "Public" or "Private" as needed
   - Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Initialize a local git repository:
   ```powershell
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files to git:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the files:
   ```powershell
   git commit -m "Initial commit: CareSyncRx application with resolved circular dependencies"
   ```

5. Add the remote repository:
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/arif-athabasca/caresyncrx.git
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Authentication

When pushing to GitHub, you'll need to authenticate:

1. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Generate a token on GitHub and use it as your password
2. **SSH Keys**: Set up SSH keys for secure authentication
3. **GitHub CLI**: Use `gh auth login` to authenticate via the GitHub CLI
4. **Git Credential Manager**: Configure a credential manager to store your credentials

## Verifying the Push

After pushing, verify your code is on GitHub by visiting:
https://github.com/arif-athabasca/caresyncrx
