CareSyncRx Development Server with Speech Support

Usage:
  .\Start-CareSyncRx-Speech.ps1              # Start regular HTTP server
  .\Start-CareSyncRx-Speech.ps1 -WithSpeech  # Start with HTTPS for speech recognition

The -WithSpeech flag enables HTTPS which is required for:
- Microphone access in modern browsers
- Speech-to-text functionality
- WebRTC features

Note: With HTTPS, browsers may show security warnings for self-signed certificates.
This is normal for development. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to localhost".
